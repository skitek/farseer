Description: farseer is a proof-of-concept package for easy machine learning
             for clinicians.
             It creates three models - linear, partition tree and neural network
             for each dependand variable specified by calling farseer function.
             Those models are automatically evaluated using bland-altman or roc curves, 
             depending of the type of the target (numeric or factor). 
             Please note that only two-level factors are currently supported.
             Those evaluations can be visualized using generic plot() function.
             An S3 farseer-class object is then created, which can be used for simulation
             on new patient data.
             The farseer.simulate does exactly that, it takes patient data, then simulates a variable
             (for example: height, age or ASA score) and for all combinations of those
             simulated variables calculates dependent variables using previously trained models.
